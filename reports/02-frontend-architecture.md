# Frontend Architecture Review

This report provides an analysis of the frontend architecture of the project, focusing on component structure, hooks, context providers, and state-management patterns. It also identifies areas for improvement and suggests refactors.

## 1. Component Structure

The project uses a mix of functional components and hooks, which is a modern and effective approach. Components are primarily located in the `components` directory, with a subdirectory `components/ui` for reusable, generic UI components. This is a good practice as it separates general-purpose UI elements from application-specific components.

However, the main `components` directory contains a mix of components for different features, which could lead to organizational challenges as the application grows.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Adopt a Feature-Folder Layout:** To improve organization, consider structuring components by feature. For example, all components related to the "influencers" feature could be placed in a `features/influencers` directory. This makes it easier to locate and maintain code related to a specific feature.
*   **Implement Atomic Design:** For a more structured approach, consider adopting atomic design principles. This involves breaking down components into smaller, reusable "atoms" (e.g., buttons, inputs), "molecules" (e.g., a search form), and "organisms" (e.g., a header). This promotes reusability and a more consistent design system.

## 2. Hooks

The project makes good use of custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic. Key hooks include:

*   `usePlatformData` and `useCountriesWithData`: For data fetching.
*   `useScreenSize`: For responsive UI logic.
*   `useSortedInfluencers`: For data manipulation.

This separation of concerns is a good practice and makes the code more modular and maintainable.

## 3. Context Providers and State Management

The application uses a combination of `useState` for local component state, `useContext` for global state, and `SWR` for remote data fetching and caching.

*   **`ThemeContext`**: This context is well-implemented and provides a simple way to manage the application's theme.
*   **`DashboardDataContext`**: This context acts as a global store for the main application data. While this is a simple approach, it can lead to performance issues and prop-drilling in larger applications. All components that consume this context will re-render when any part of the data changes, which can be inefficient.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Refactor `DashboardDataContext`**: For more complex state management, consider replacing the `DashboardDataContext` with a more robust state management library like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit**. These libraries provide more advanced features for managing state, such as memoized selectors and the ability to subscribe to specific parts of the state, which can help to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Use Zod for Validation**: The project already has `zod` as a dependency, but it's not used consistently. Using Zod schemas to validate all data coming from the API and user input would improve data integrity and reduce runtime errors.

## 4. Prop-Drilling

There is some evidence of prop-drilling, where props are passed down through multiple levels of components. For example, the `reportRef` and platform/country data are passed down from the main page to the `Sidebar` and other components.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Use Context or State Management**: To avoid prop-drilling, consider using context or a state management library to provide data to the components that need it directly. For example, the `reportRef` could be managed in a separate context.

## 5. Code Duplication

There is some code duplication between `app/page.tsx` and `app/admin/page.tsx`, particularly in the data fetching and state management logic. The `getCurrentStats`, `getCurrentInfluencers`, `getCurrentDemographics`, and `getCurrentInterests` functions are very similar in both files.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Create Reusable Hooks or Components**: To reduce duplication, consider creating reusable hooks or components that encapsulate the common logic. For example, you could create a `useDashboardData` hook that provides the current data based on the selected platform and country.

## 6. Typing

The project uses TypeScript, which is a great choice for improving code quality and maintainability. However, there are several instances where the `any` type is used, particularly in `app/admin/page.tsx` and `DashboardDataContext`. This reduces the benefits of using TypeScript.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Reduce `any` Usage**: Strive to eliminate the use of `any` as much as possible. Define specific types for all data structures and use them consistently throughout the application. This will improve type safety and make the code easier to understand and refactor.

## Summary of Recommendations

*   **Component Structure**: Adopt a feature-folder layout and consider atomic design principles.
*   **State Management**: Refactor `DashboardDataContext` to use a more robust state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
*   **Data Validation**: Use Zod schemas for all data validation.
*   **Prop-Drilling**: Use context or a state management library to avoid prop-drilling.
*   **Code Duplication**: Create reusable hooks and components to reduce code duplication.
*   **Typing**: Reduce the use of `any` to improve type safety.

By implementing these recommendations, you can improve the overall quality, maintainability, and scalability of the frontend architecture.
