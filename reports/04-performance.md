# Performance Profiling Report

This report summarizes the performance analysis of the Next.js application, focusing on build times, bundle sizes, and runtime performance. The analysis was conducted on a Next.js application with static export configuration.

## Build Performance (`next build --profile`)

The `next build --profile` command was executed to generate a production build and gather performance metrics. The application uses static export (`output: "export"`) which affects the build process and deployment strategy.

### Build Summary

| Route (app) | Size | First Load JS | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| / | 9.88 kB | 302 kB | Home page - heaviest JS load |
| /_not-found | 871 B | 88.3 kB | Minimal error page |
| /admin | 33.8 kB | 157 kB | Admin dashboard - largest page bundle |
| /api/platform-data | 0 B | 0 B | API route (server-side) |
| /campaigns | 1.23 kB | 257 kB | Campaign management |
| /data-editor | 5.5 kB | 292 kB | Data editing interface |
| /influencers | 1.22 kB | 257 kB | Influencer management |
| /payments | 1.28 kB | 257 kB | Payment interface |
| /settings | 1.73 kB | 258 kB | Settings page |
| /team | 1.2 kB | 257 kB | Team management |
| **First Load JS shared by all** | **87.4 kB** | | Shared chunk contains common dependencies |

### Key Findings

- **Largest First Load JS**: Home page (302 kB) and data-editor (292 kB)
- **Shared Bundle Size**: 87.4 kB across all pages
- **Main Chunk Contributors**: 
  - `chunks/23-64d75aba9a0da961.js`: 31.7 kB
  - `chunks/fd9d1056-f5e78e79626db048.js`: 53.6 kB (largest chunk)
- **D3.js Impact**: D3 v7.9.0 is imported in multiple components, contributing significantly to bundle size
- **GeoJSON Data**: 25 kB `world-countries.geojson` file loaded at runtime

## Runtime Performance (React Profiler)

To analyze runtime performance, you can use the React DevTools Profiler. Due to the limitations of my current environment, I cannot directly interact with the browser to capture profiling data.

## Lighthouse Audits

Similarly, I am unable to run Lighthouse audits directly. It is highly recommended to run these audits from Chrome DevTools on both mobile and desktop to get a comprehensive performance overview.

## Recommendations

Based on the build analysis and general best practices, here are some recommendations to improve the performance of your application:

### Code-Splitting and Dynamic Imports

- **What:** Load JavaScript components and libraries only when they are needed, rather than including them in the initial bundle.
- **Why:** Reduces the initial page load time.
- **How:** Use `next/dynamic` for dynamic imports of components and pages. For example, modals, or components that are only visible on user interaction, are good candidates for dynamic imports.

### Memoization

- **What:** Cache the results of expensive function calls and re-use them when the same inputs occur again.
- **Why:** Avoids re-rendering components unnecessarily, which can improve runtime performance.
- **How:** Use `React.memo` for functional components and `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks for memoizing values and functions within your components.

### Image Optimization

- **What:** Serve images in modern formats (like WebP) and correctly size them for different devices.
- **Why:** Reduces the file size of images, which can significantly improve page load times.
- **How:** Use the `next/image` component, which automatically optimizes images.

### HTTP Caching and CDN Usage

- **What:** Configure caching headers to instruct the browser to store assets locally. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve assets from locations closer to the user.
- **Why:** Reduces latency and server load.
- **How:** Next.js automatically sets caching headers for immutable assets. For a CDN, you can configure the `assetPrefix` in your `next.config.js` or use a platform like Vercel or Netlify, which provide this out of the box.
